# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Modern Basic Calculator

A modern basic calculator built with React + TypeScript + Vite + vanilla JavaScript.

This project was built to improve my problem solving approach by implementing
a Shunt Yard Algorithm that checks for operator precedence, demonstrating
algorithmic thinking and clean architecture.

### Features

- Expression parsing (infix → postfix, no eval)

## Screenshots

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm or yarn install -y
3. npm run dev

### Challenges & Learnings

- Implemented the Shunting Yard Algorithm for expression parsing
- Handled floating-point precision errors
- Designed keyboard-safe input validation

### Future Improvements

- Voice input support
- PWA offline mode
- Cloud-synced calculation history
- Scientific calculations (sin, cos, log, sqrt)
- Keyboard input support
- Calculation history with reuse
- Dark / Light mode
- Unit & currency conversion
